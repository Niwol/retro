I am making this project in the first place to teach myself more about game developpement and to learn Bevy: the game engine I am using.

What I am especialy trying to learn here is:
* Organising and writing clean code (There is definitly stuff to improve here)
* How to implement simple game rules
* Create good gaming experience (gameplay, intuitive menus...)

Feel free to give feedback on thoes different points, I am happy to recieve it whether it is positive or negative. I know that there is already a lot to improve in the project so far so I am open to constructive critisism.

That said, I am probably not going to change much in the finished games as I have other projects in mind that I would like to work on in my free time :)
